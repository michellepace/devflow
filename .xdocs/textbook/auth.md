# Types of Authentication

There are various ways to implement authentication and authorization on the web:

## 1. Session-based

With session-based authentication, a session is created on the server for each user after they log in. The server then sends a unique session identifier (usually stored as a cookie) to the client, which is used for subsequent requests to authenticate the user

🍪 What's a cookie?: A cookie is a small piece of data that a web server sends to a user's web browser. The browser then stores this data and sends it back with every subsequent request to the same server. Cookies are commonly used for various purposes, including session management, tracking user preferences, and personalizing user experiences. You can think of cookies as a way for websites to remember users and their preferences across different sessions.

Workflow

- When a user logs in, the server generates a unique session ID and stores session data (like user ID, expiration time, etc.) on the server side.
- The server sets a cookie in the response containing the session ID.
- For subsequent requests, the client sends the session ID along with the request.
- The server verifies the session ID against the stored session data to authenticate the user.

Pros

- Secure: Session data is stored on the server, reducing the risk of token theft.
- Easy to implement: Many web frameworks provide built-in support for session management.
- Automatic expiration: Sessions can be set to expire after a certain period, enhancing security.

Cons

- Scalability issues: Storing session data on the server can lead to scalability challenges, especially in distributed systems.
- Server-side storage: Requires server resources to manage session data, increasing server load.
- Vulnerable to CSRF attacks: Session identifiers stored in cookies can be susceptible to CSRF attacks if not properly secured.

## 2. Token-based (JWT)

With token-based authentication, a token containing user information is generated upon successful login and sent to the client. This token is then included in subsequent requests to authenticate the user.

Workflow

- Upon successful authentication, the server generates a JWT containing user information and signs it with a secret key.
- The server sends the JWT to the client, usually in the response body or as a header.
- The client includes the JWT in the header of subsequent requests.
- The server verifies the JWT's signature and decodes its payload to authenticate the user.

Pros

- Stateless: Tokens contain all necessary information for authentication, eliminating the need for server-side storage.
- Scalable: Tokens can be easily distributed across multiple servers, improving scalability.
- Enhanced security: Tokens can be encrypted and signed to prevent tampering and unauthorized access.

Cons

- Token management: Requires additional effort to manage token lifecycle, including expiration and revocation.
- Token size: Tokens can be larger than session identifiers, increasing network overhead.
- Vulnerable to token theft: If not properly secured (e.g., through HTTPS), tokens can be intercepted and used by malicious actors.

## 3. OAuth

OAuth is a protocol for delegated authorization, allowing third-party services to access a user's resources without exposing their credentials. Users can grant limited access to their data to external applications.

Workflow

- Register your application with the OAuth provider and obtain client credentials (client ID and client secret).
- Redirect users to the OAuth provider's authentication endpoint.
- After authentication, the OAuth provider redirects the user back to your application with an authorization code.
- Exchange the authorization code for an access token and optionally a refresh token.
- Use the access token to access the user's resources on behalf of the user.

Pros

- Single sign-on (SSO): Users can access multiple services with a single set of credentials, improving user experience.
- Granular permissions: Users can grant limited access to their resources, enhancing privacy and security.
- Widely supported: OAuth is a widely adopted standard used by many popular services and platforms.

Cons

- Complexity: Implementing OAuth can be complex, requiring understanding of the protocol and its various flows.
- Trust dependency: Users must trust third-party services with access to their data, raising privacy concerns.
- Token management: Requires handling of access tokens and refresh tokens, adding complexity to authentication flow.

## 4. Basic authentication

Basic authentication involves users providing their credentials (username and password) with each request, encoded and sent to the server. It's simple but less secure compared to other methods.

Workflow

- Clients encode the username and password in a Base64-encoded string and includes it in the request header.
- The server decodes the string, extracts the credentials, and validates them against the stored credentials.

Pros

- Simple to implement: Requires minimal setup and configuration, making it easy to get started.
- Universal support: Basic authentication is supported by virtually all web browsers and servers.
- No session management: Does not require server-side storage or session management, reducing server load.

Cons

- Lack of security: Credentials are sent with every request, increasing the risk of interception and unauthorized access.
- No encryption: Credentials are sent in plaintext, making them vulnerable to interception.
- Limited functionality: Does not support features like session management or granular permissions, limiting its usability in complex applications.

⚠️ **Warning**: Avoid using basic authentication for sensitive applications as credentials are sent with every request, making them susceptible to interception.

These authentication methods serve different purposes and have varying levels of security and complexity. Choosing the right one depends on factors such as the application's requirements, security considerations, and user experience.
